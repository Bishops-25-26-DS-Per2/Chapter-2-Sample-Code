# Chapter 2 Sample Code

Here you will find:
1. `conventions.py`  This has some help on how to keep under the 80 character limit, how to include two data types in a type annotation, and how to correctly write a docstring.
2. `examples_parameters.py`  This includes two examples we did in class on the whiteboard, with some added examples.
3. `local_global.py`  This shows some examples about scope of variables to answer some questions about how to use the global keyword.  In general, it is not a great idea to use global variables, you should make them local and pass them as arguments/returns if needed.
4. `parameters_1.py` This shows some starting examples about positional and keyword arguments, plus examples of how to use the *args and **kwargs
5. `parameters_2.py` This shows some more complex examples, and demonstrates the use of /, and *, as parameters.
6. `overloading.py` This shows how to write a function that behaves differently depending on the data type of the input.
